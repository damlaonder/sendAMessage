# sendAMessage

This is a project I worked on when I first started learning how to code with python. 

It imitates a messaging app. So, using functions and loops, this is a program in which the user needs to register an account. After registering their account, they can log in. I use files I/O to store the usernames and passwords. After the program determines that the log in is validated, the user can either send messages, read messages, delete messages, or log out. I use files I/O again to store the messages for future access. When the user chooses to read their messages, they get the time info of the message as well.  

At the end of the program, the user can log out and quit.
